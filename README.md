# SafeShield
old src of my roblox plugin for scanning viruses\
never got around to fully releasing it

## Detections
this plugin detects viruses/backdoors in 15+ diffference services\
some of the detection methods include, name checking, script checking, ascii lettering, hexidecimal lettering, and base64 decoding

## Gui
the gui is not included with this repo, but it consists of the main ui, the settings ui, and the whitelist ui
